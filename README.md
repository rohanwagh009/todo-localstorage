## Core Functionality

The main feature of this application is its ability to remember tasks. By utilizing the browser's **Local Storage**, all to-do items are saved and retrieved across browsing sessions, ensuring that user data is not lost upon closing the tab.

Key features include:

- **Task Creation:** A user-friendly input field to seamlessly add new tasks to the list.
- **Task Deletion:** An option to permanently remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent State:** Your task list remains exactly as you left it, providing a consistent user experience.

## Tech Stack

This project was built from the ground up using:

- **JavaScript:** For all logic, DOM manipulation, and interaction with Local Storage.
- **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the application.
- **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsive design.
